      <h2>Official Pathways to South Korea (Agent-Free)</h2>

      <div class="path">
        <h3>1. For Work: The EPS (Employment Permit System)</h3>
        <p>This is the official and safest government-to-government system for non-professional jobs in manufacturing, agriculture, fisheries, and construction.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1: Master the Language.</strong> You MUST pass the TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean). Register when the Korean Ministry of Justice announces the schedule. Study using official EPS-KLT prep books.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2: Get on the Roster.</strong> After passing EPS-TOPIK with the required score, you will be entered into Pakistan's EPS Overseas Job Seekers Roster. Registration happens at designated centers (OEEC in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta, Lahore).</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3: Job Selection & Visa.</strong> Korean employers select candidates directly from this roster. If selected, you will go through medical exams, sign a standard employment contract, and apply for the E-9 Visa directly at the Korean Embassy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Resource:</strong> Bookmark Pakistan OEC website and HRD Korea website for official announcements.</p>

      <div class="path">
        <h3>2. For Study: Direct University Application</h3>
        <p>For degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) or language courses.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1: Research & Choose.</strong> Find programs on Study in Korea (<a href="https://www.studyingkorea.go.kr" target="_blank">www.studyingkorea.go.kr</a>) or university websites. Check English or Korean-taught programs.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2: Meet Requirements.</strong> For degree programs: Prepare transcripts, proof of finances, study plan, letters of recommendation. TOPIK score for Korean programs or TOEFL/IELTS for English programs. Language courses: Apply to Korean Language Institutes (Yonsei KLI, Sogang KLEC).</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3: Apply Directly.</strong> Submit your application online or via post. If accepted, you will receive a Visa Issuance Number (D-2 or D-4).</li>
          <li><strong>Step 4: Apply for Visa.</strong> Take admission letter & Visa Issuance Number to Korean Embassy in Islamabad.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="path">
        <h3>3. The H-1 (Working Holiday) Visa</h3>
        <p>For young Pakistanis (if/when the bilateral agreement is active). Allows living, traveling, and part-time work in Korea for a year. Apply directly at the Korean Embassy. Requires proof of funds, travel insurance, and a clean record.</p>

    <!-- Crucial Steps Section -->
    <section class="crucial-steps">
      <h2>Crucial Steps for EVERYONE (The DIY Foundation)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Learn Korean:</strong> For EPS, pass EPS-TOPIK. For study/jobs, aim for TOPIK Level 3 or higher.</li>
        <li><strong>Gather Documents Yourself:</strong> Police Character Certificate, Educational Documents (attested), Financial Proof.</li>
        <li><strong>Use ONLY Official Websites:</strong> Korean Embassy in Pakistan, POEA, HRD Korea / Ministry of Justice, University Websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare for Costs:</strong> Application fees, language tests, document attestation, visa fees, flights. Any "guaranteed job" offer asking for huge upfront money is a SCAM.</li>

      <h2>Our Vision: A Bridge to Opportunity</h2>
      <h3>Building a Bridge, One Word at a Time</h3>
      <p>
        At [Your Institute Name], we understand that true potential should never be limited by borders.
        We see a generation in Pakistan, full of ambition, skill, and determination, seeking opportunities in nations like China, Japan, South Korea, and Germany. The primary barrier is often language.
      </p>
      <h4>The Challenge We Address:</h4>
      <p>
        Pakistan's economic hardship compels many skilled individuals to look outward for stability and growth. Learning the local language is essential for safety, understanding, and success abroad.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Vision in Action:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Economic necessity is met with educational empowerment.</li>
        <li>Professionals are not just workers, but integrated contributors.</li>
        <li>Migration is safe, informed, and dignified.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Our Commitment:</h4>
      <p>
        We are more than a language institute. We are a launchpad. We provide practical language for work, study, and daily life in your destination country.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Call to Vision:</h4>
      <p>Your dream of a better future is valid. Let us equip you with the tool you need to claim it. We envision your success as our own, and we are here to build that bridge with you, word by word, lesson by lesson.</p>
